## Apollo Client

```javascript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';
import { GraphQLClient, gql } from 'graphql-request';
import { getAccessToken } from '../auth';

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:9000/graphql',
  // Cache data returned from the server "in memory"
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

NOTE:
- The @apollo/client `gql` is used to parse GraphQL query strings into an AST that Apollo Client can process. It integrates well with the Apollo's features like caching, state management etc.
- The graphql-request is more minimal and is a template literal tag used to define GraphQL queries, mutations or subscriptions in a format that it can send to a GraphQL server.

## Making requests

```javascript
// Query
const { data } = await apolloClient.query({ query });
const { data } = await apolloClient.query({ 
  query,
  variables: { id }
});

// Mutation
const { data } = await apolloClient.mutate({
  mutation,
  variables: { input: { title, description } }
});
```

## Making authorised requests

There are two ways to set the header; one by sending a context object per request.

```javascript
const { data } = await apolloClient.mutate({
  mutation,
  variables: { input: { title, description } },
  context: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${getAccessToken()}`,
    },
  }
});
```

Another way is by using the `Apollo Link` that lets use customize the flow of data between Apollo Client and our GraphQL server. We can define our client's network behavior as a chain of link objects that execute in a sequence.

```javascript
const httpLink = createHttpLink({ uri: 'http://localhost:9000/graphql' });

const customLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
  console.log("[customLink] operation:", operation);
  const accessToken = getAccessToken();
  if (accessToken) {
    operation.setContext({
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}` }
    });
  }
  return forward(operation);
});

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:9000/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: concat(customLink, httpLink),
});
```

Apollo Links are a way to customize and control how GraphQL requests flow throught the network. They are like middleware that can inspect, modify, react to GraphQL operations before they are sent or after responses are received. This makes it easy to:
- Add auth headers
- Log requests/responses
- Retry failed requests
- Queue or batch operations
- Split traffic b/w multiple endpoints

**createHttpLink**  
This creates the final piece of the link which actually sends the GraphQL request over HTTP to the server. This link:
- Knows the target server URI
- Converts the GraphQL operation into a proper HTTP POST request
- Sends it to the server
- Returns the response

**concat**  
Joins two Apollo Links into a chain, this operation flows through each link in the order they are concatenated:
- customLink: Runs first and will add headers
- httpLink: Will send the request

## Apollo Client Cache

After integrating @apollo/client, we noticed that previously made requests are cachedâ€”for example, when listing jobs or viewing a company's details. This caching behavior prevents duplicate requests to the server for the same data, as long as the data hasn't changed or been mutated.

Apollo stores the objects by a unique identifier, usually inferred from the __typename + id combo.

```javascript
{
  Job: {
    "123": { id: "123", title: "Engineer", company: { __ref: "Company:1" } }
  },
  Company: {
    "1": { id: "1", name: "TechCorp" }
  }
}
```

So if a mutation updates `Job:123` or `Company:1`, Apollo knows exactly what part of the cache is affected, and can automatically update or invalidate it.

## Fetch Policy

By default it caches our responses but we can change it at the query as well global level.

```javascript
  const { data } = await apolloClient.query({ 
    query,
    fetchPolicy: 'network-only'
  });
```

Common policy can be applied to the `ApolloClient` object.

```javascript
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:9000/graphql',
  // Cache data returned from the server "in memory"
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: concat(customLink, httpLink),
  defaultOptions: {
    query: {
      fetchPolicy: 'network-only', // Always fetch fresh data from the server
    },
    watchQuery: {
      fetchPolicy: 'cache-and-network', // Use cache but also fetch fresh data
    }
  }
});
```

Other cache policies are:
- `cache-first`: Reads from the cache first, if data is not present, it fetches from the network.
- `network-only`: Always fetches over the network, no caching is involved.
- `cache-only`: Always read from cache.

You can read more about the caching policies from [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries).

## Cache manipulation

We can write to the cache directly to avoid making extra network calls. We can use it for Optimistic UI Updates. Eg: Create a job and navigating to the jobs details page makes two API calls, one to create a job; another one to get the newly created job by ID.

```javascript
export async function createJob({ title, description }) {
  const mutation = gql`...`;
  const { data } = await apolloClient.mutate({
    mutation,
    variables: { input: { title, description } },
    update: (cache, result) => {
      cache.writeQuery(({
        query: jobByIdQuery,
        variables: { id: result.data.job.id },
        data: result.data
      }))
    }
  });
  return data.job;
}
```

This example writes the data to the cache, which our web app can use to display the job details job.


## Fragments

This is the feature of the schema definition language.

```javascript
// The "Job" type must match the type defined in the server's schema
// It tells GraphQL which type the fields inside the fragment belong to
fragment JobDescription on Job {
  id
  date
  description
  company {
    name
  }
}

// Using the fragement
query JobById($jobId: ID!) {
  job(id: $jobId) {
    ...JobDescription
  }
}
```

And this is how we can use it in React:

```javascript
const jobDetailsFragment = gql`
  fragment JobDetails on Job {
    id
    title
    date
    description
    company {
      id
      name
      description
    }
  }
`;

export const jobByIdQuery = gql`
  ${jobDetailsFragment}
  query GetJob($id: ID!) {
    job(id: $id) {
      ...JobDetails
    }
  }
`;
```

## Apollo Provider

To fully utilize the functionalities provided by the apollo client, we use the `ApolloProvider` component.

This lets us use the `useQuery` hook that provides extra state variables.

```javascript
export const companyByIdQuery = gql`
  query CompanyById($id: ID!) {
    company(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      description
      jobs {
        id
        date
        title
      }
    }
  }
`;

// Now the code looks much cleaner without the useEffect/useState hooks
// Now we can remove every function that 
const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(companyByIdQuery, {
  variable: { id: companyId }
});
```
